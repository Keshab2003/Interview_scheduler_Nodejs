**Intelligent Job Description Uploader with Voice Assistant**
This project is a smart job description uploader integrated with a voice-based assistant powered by a machine learning model. 
The system enables seamless interaction with candidates through voice, helping to assess their interest and availability for a job opportunity in real time.

The voice assistant leverages natural language understanding to analyze candidate responses and extract key intents, such as:

Candidateâ€™s interest in the job?
Current and expected CTC (Cost to Company)?
Notice period the candidate is currently serving?
Availability for an interview?

Based on the extracted information, the system evaluates whether the candidate meets the job criteria (e.g., CTC and notice period brackets). 
If eligible, it proceeds to schedule an interview based on the candidate's stated availability.
